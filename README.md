### (CS50 Final Project)
This is my final project for CS50. It's a simple web application built with Flask for finding recipes.

To run this application locally, run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dansarpong/CS50-Final.git
cd CS50-Final
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=application.py
flask run
```
Then, open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
